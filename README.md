# NodeBB Category Info

This NodeBB plugin adds latest post information to each category block on the home page. Utilizes masonry to stack category blocks neatly.

This plugin also serves as an example on how to serve modified/custom templates. You could replace an individual block within a template and serve that. This way your plugin can be future-proofed to changes made in and around that file in later NodeBB releases.
